Problem: Swap Two Variables Without Temporary Variable

Description:
Given two integer variables a and b, swap their values
without using a third (temporary) variable.

Input:
Two integers a and b.

Output:
After swapping, print the new values of a and b.

Example:
Input:
a = 5
b = 9

Output:
a = 9
b = 5

Constraints:
- No temporary variable is allowed
- Integers can be positive or negative

Purpose:
This problem tests basic algorithmic thinking and
understanding of arithmetic or bitwise operations.
