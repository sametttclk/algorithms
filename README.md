# Algorithms

This repository contains my Java solutions for various algorithm problems.  
It is designed to demonstrate clean code, problem-solving skills, and algorithmic thinking.

## Structure

- `algorithms/`: Contains problem categories
  - `warmup/`: Basic problems
    - `PlusMinus/`
      - `problem.txt` - problem description
      - `Solution.java` - solution code
  - `implementation/`: More complex problems

## Purpose

- Practice Java and algorithmic problem-solving
- Improve code readability and maintainability
- Build a portfolio demonstrating understanding of common algorithm patterns
- Showcase ability to structure projects professionally

## How to Run

Each problem folder contains a `Solution.java` file.  
You can compile and run it using:

```bash
javac Solution.java
java Solution
